Hello World, thanks for checking out my repos! I love a good tech pun & learning new skills. Some of my repos are based on assignment, and others are passion projects. As a certified MERN stack developer most of my code includes the end-to-end framework of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. However, I am frequently learning new languages and tech skills to see what else is out there. Follow along as I code my way through life.
